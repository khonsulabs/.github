# What is Khonsu Labs?

Khonsu Labs is the passion-project of [@ecton][ecton] (the author of this
profile). I originall started Khonsu Labs with the goal of developing [Cosmic
Verge][cosmicverge], but am currently focused on building [BonsaiDb][bonsaidb].
Everything Khonsu Labs does is open-source under both the MIT License and the
Apache License 2.0.

While Khonsu Labs legally is only [@ecton][ecton], we have a small yet active
community that all share a vision of making [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) the
best language for general purpose application development.
