# What is Khonsu Labs?

Khonsu Labs is the passion-project of [@ecton][ecton] (the author of this
profile). I originally started Khonsu Labs with the goal of developing a game,
but am currently focused on building:

- [Cushy][cushy]
- [BonsaiDb][bonsaidb]
  - [OkayWAL][okaywal]
  - [Sediment][sediment]
  - [Nebari][nebari]

Everything Khonsu Labs does is open-source under both the MIT License and the
Apache License 2.0. We are a small yet active community that share a vision of
making [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) the best language for general purpose
application development.

## Interacting with us

- **GitHub Issues/Discussions**: If you're wanting to request a feature, file an
  issue, or ask a question, the GitHub repository for the project is a great
  place to start.
- [**Zulip**](https://zulip.khonsulabs.com): Zulip is sponsoring a community
  instance for Khonsu Labs's open-source projects. This server is less populated
  than the Discord server because it's newer, but [@ecton][ecton] prefers
  discussions on Zulip over Discord.
- [**Discord**](https://discord.khonsulabs.com): We have a Discord server where
  we chat, co-work, and occasionally play games.
- [**Discourse Forums**](https://community.khonsulabs.com/): Our community
  forums are where we post devlogs/announcements and discuss topics that are
  better discussed with long-form writing.
